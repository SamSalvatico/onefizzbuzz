# onefizzbuzz - Samuele Salvatico

This code was developed on Ubuntu 20.04 and tested using PHP 7.2.32.

Assuming that PHP is installed on your PC, to run the script you have to open the terminal into the script folder and run
```
php -f oneFizzBuzz.php
```

Et voil√†! Here there are the FizzBuzzed values!

### Hint
The default max value to fizz buzz is 20, if you want to set your own you can run

```
php -f oneFizzBuzz.php yourOwnIntegereValue
```

E.g.

```
php -f oneFizzBuzz.php 10
```
